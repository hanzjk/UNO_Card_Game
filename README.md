## **Guide to Play the Game**

STEP 1: Dealer/program shuffles the deck and deals 7 cards face down to each player. Place the  remaining cards face down to form a Draw Pile. 

STEP 2: The rest of the cards are placed in a Draw Pile and turns over the top card to begin a Discard Pile. 

STEP 3: The players have to find a card from their hands that matches the top card of the Discard Pile either by the color or the face value.Then the player should click on the  card from his/her hand to add it to the Pile. Players can also play a Wild card or a Wild Draw Four card anytime they like. 

STEP 4: If the player has no matches, they must draw a card by clicking the Draw pile. If that  card can be played, play it. Otherwise, keep the card. 

STEP 5: After a match is made or a card is drawn from the Draw Pile it will automatically move  to the next players turn. The moment a player has just one card he/she must click ‘UNO’ before  clicking on the last card. If not, that player must draw two new cards as a penalty. 

STEP 6: The round ends when one player is out of cards and he/she will receive points according  to the values of the remaining cards in other players’ hands. A new round will begin until one of the players score 500 points. The first player to score 500 points wins the game.
